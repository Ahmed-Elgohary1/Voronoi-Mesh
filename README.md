# Voronoi-Mesh
a C++ meshing program from scratch in which we generate the best 2d unstructured mesh using cutting-edge techniques
### ( Voronoi cells, Delaunay triangulation, and Maximal Poisson-Disk Sampling problem ) ðŸ¦„

It can make Voronoi mesh for any shape and separate it into domains while decreasing the time complexity and magnitude of memory used
compared to commonly used techniques
