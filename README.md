# Voronoi-Mesh Generator

This C++ program generates a Voronoi mesh using Voronoi cells, Delaunay triangulation, and the [Maximal Poisson-Disk Sampling problem](https://github.com/Ahmed-Elgohary1/Mesh-generation). The program takes a set of points as input and generates a Voronoi diagram, which is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on the distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. The Voronoi diagram is then used to create a mesh, which is a collection of vertices, edges, and faces that define a 2D object.

It can make Voronoi mesh for any shape and separate it into domains while decreasing the time complexity and magnitude of memory used
compared to commonly used techniques. ðŸ¦„
